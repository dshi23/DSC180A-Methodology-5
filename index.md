1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

    __The most interesting topic covered in our domain is about over-parameterized networks and feature learning. In the sections, we went over how a network can recover which features is the case in a single index model as an example. And we went further on how networks learn features on image data for our projects.__

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

    __One potential investigation we would like to pursue for our Quarter 2 Project is to applying what we did in Quarter Project 1 on another different dataset, for example CIFAR-10.__

3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

    __One potential change will be doing more visualizations of the filters and layers for our network, especially the layers in each epoch.__

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

    __Other techniques would be analyzing how feature are extracted through training instead of just verifying feature leaning is done with training on our dataset.__
